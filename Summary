Network Topology
The following machines were identified on the network:
Name of VM 1
Operating System:Linux
Purpose:Target 1
IP Address: 192.168.1.110
Name of VM 2
Operating System: Linux
Purpose: Target 2
IP Address: 192.168.1.115

Description of Targets
The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110).
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
Alert 1: Excessive HTTP Errors 
Alert 1   is implemented as follows:
Metric: monitor for excessive HTTP errors
Threshold: >400 for 5 minutes
Vulnerability Mitigated: Shows the requests related to the HTTP web requests. Identifies periods of time when there is an excessive amount of requests within 5 minutes. 
Reliability: Medium reliability since this alert creates false positives for valid requests. 

Alert 2: HTTP Request Size Monitor
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
Metric: monitor the HTTP size of bytes of size requested 
Threshold: >3500 bytes per 1 minute
Vulnerability Mitigated: Shows when there is excess network traffic based on the average traffic that is seen on a regular basis. 
Reliability: High reliability since the alert is based on average traffic and monitors based on that average. 
Alert 3: CPU Usage Monitor
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
Metric: monitor the CPU Usage
Threshold: >.5 for 5 minutes
Vulnerability Mitigated: Shows excess resources being used in a given timeframe
Reliability: High reliability the alert will not create a lot of false results.
